<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm finally starting my education as a web developer! I have little to no expirience but I'm very passionate about learning. 
  Since a teenager and during the days of Myspace (I feel old saying that) I taught myself to read & manipulate HTML. I hope to one day 
  work as a full stack developer & will work hard to acheive that goal!
